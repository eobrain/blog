title: 50 Most Frequently Used Chinese Characters Presented in an Easy-to-Learn Way

I created this list of Chinese characters for my own benefit in trying to learn them.  I took Jun Da's list of most frequently used characters and added a Google image search to provide some mnemonics.  I added tone-color and exaggerated tone marks to the pinyin to help remind me of the the tones.

See this [on a separate page](http://eamonn.org/zi50.html) with links to shorter and longer lists of characters.

(Note, this may look ugly if you are using Internet Explorer.  It should look better on Firefox, Chrome, or Safari.  I need to do a bit more CSS-hacking to make it work on IE.)
