Last night we saw the film "Control Room", a behind-the scenes documentary of Al Jazeera covering the initial invasion of Iraq.

I watched some coverage of the war from the Arab side on the Mosaic news program so there was nothing really new factually in this film for me.  It was still well worth seeing however as it, for example, demonstrated the complicated realities of how journalists, whether from Fox News or Al Jazeera, unavoidably bring a point of view to their coverage, however committed they are to reporting the "truth".

One of the compelling characters in the film was a press officer at Central Command whom [Salon reports](http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2004/06/04/control_room/index_np.html) is being muzzled by the Pentagon.
