I am currently writing some code to render 3-D scenes to 2-D.  I found this [Perspective Camera Transformation](http://www.cs.brown.edu/exploratories/freeSoftware/repository/edu/brown/cs/exploratories/applets/camera/perspective_camera_transformation_java_browser.html) applet useful for getting an intuitive feel for the concepts.
