  * [dist/script.js at master from ded/script.js - GitHub](https://github.com/ded/script.js/blob/master/dist/script.js) Asynchronous JavaScript loading can increase the responsiveness of your web site to your users.  Here is a nice easy-to-use JavaScript loader that can handle arbitrarily complex dependencies in the client-side of your app. (tags:                      [javascript](http://www.diigo.com/user/eobrain/javascript)            [api](http://www.diigo.com/user/eobrain/api)            [library](http://www.diigo.com/user/eobrain/library)            [programming](http://www.diigo.com/user/eobrain/programming))
  * [defunkt/jquery-pjax - GitHub](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax) Pjax is a nice way to get a responsive web app. It has a similar effect as a single-page javascript/json app, but allows for more conventional server-side programming and easier fallback for old browsers. (tags:                      [javascript](http://www.diigo.com/user/eobrain/javascript))
