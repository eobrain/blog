This is now a beta location new location for my blog. Once I sort
out some remaining formatting issues on so of the old articles on the
new location, I am going to retire the [old location](http://www.eamonn.org/blog/).

I finally decided that WordPress installation on a shared Dreamhost
server was just too slow. So I made the leap to the Jekyll platform.

Instead of hacking around in WordPressâ€™ PHP I can now customize my
blog in Ruby and Coffeescript. And because the blog is statically
served I am hosting it out of S3, giving much faster, scalable
performance.

For those that care, you can see the
[source behind the blog](https://github.com/eobrain/blog), which
started as a template by Kris Brown.
