Jamie Beckett at HP Labs has [a blog entry](http://www.communities.hp.com/online/blogs/labsblog/archive/2008/07/09/free-automatic-photo-enhancement.aspx) on [one of the Snapfish Lab tools](http://www.snapfishlab.com/PublicAboutPhotoTool.do?tool=HIPIE) which automatically applies seven proprietary enhancement algorithms to improve your photograph.  See [Jamie's article](http://www.communities.hp.com/online/blogs/labsblog/archive/2008/07/09/free-automatic-photo-enhancement.aspx) for more information.

(Disclosure: I was the architect for Snapfish Lab when it was launched, and still help out with it.)
