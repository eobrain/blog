A blaring alarm roused us, hearts a pounding, from a deep sleep at 2am. As soon as we realized that it must be the fire alarm we hurridly threw on clothes and headed down the emergency stairs and joined the other guests in the lobby.

Two Fire Department vehicles came and after investigating for a bit they declared the all clear.  Apparently it had been a false alarm.
