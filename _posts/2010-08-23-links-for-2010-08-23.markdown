[Gremlin: A Graph-Based Programming Language](http://www.slideshare.net/slidarko/gremlin-a-graphbased-programming-language-3876581)


This is a Java-embeddable language that can perform queries on generalized graphs using a clear and concise XPath-based query language.  In addition it adds typical scripting constructs that  make it a complete language.  However these additions seem weak, and I think a pure query language (like SQL) would have been better.

One thing I thought was a bit inelegant was the number of special reserved identifiers in the query language, such as "outE", "inE", "outV", and "inV".  I understand this was necessary to stay compatible with XPath, but I think it would have been better to move away from XPath and put such special identifiers in the syntax of the language.

I did like was how easy it is to define computed edges in the graph, sort of like views in SQL.  This can be considered a kind of reasoning.  I particularly was struck by the clear insight in the presentation that "Graph-based reasoning is the process of making explicit what is implicit in lop co-developer the graph"
