One of the nice things about the Irish language is that its spelling is very regular. However for non-Irish speakers some of the pronunciation rules can be confusing.

This is particularly true of some of the lengthened consonants which in the modern spelling are indicated by adding an “h”:


“th” and ”sh”
(pronounced /h/)


“bh” and ”mh”
(pronounced /w/ or /v/ depending on context)


dh” and ”gh”
(pronounced /y/ or a /g/, /h/ mixture depending on context)


“fh”
(silent)


I propose that we adopt a new spelling system that is more accessible to non-Irish speakers.
