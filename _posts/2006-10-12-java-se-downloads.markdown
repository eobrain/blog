I had to go to Sun's [Java SE Downloads](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp) web site to download Java, which is not available via the Ubuntu installer.  I considered using one of the open source Java SDKs intead but I make extensive use of Java 1.5 features which are not yet I think well supported by non-Sun compilers.

The installation is not quite as magic as the Windows installation but it is fairly convenient.  You get a self-extracting file that you execute. This simply unpacks the Java SDK into a directory.  I just left the SDK directory as a subdirectory of my home directory.  No root access needed; no messing around with system areas needed.
