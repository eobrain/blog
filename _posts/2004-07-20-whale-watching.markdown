Just back from an amazing whale-watching boat trip on the straits between San Juan Island, Washington State and Vancouver Island, British Columbia. We were lucky in that all of the local pods of Orca had come together to socialize and hunt for the salmon sheltering from the strong ebb tide currents in coves along the coast.  We saw lots of the orca swimming along in family groups, splashing about as they herded the salmon, and popping their heads out of the water to keep an eye on the boats.
