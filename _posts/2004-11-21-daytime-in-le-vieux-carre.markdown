Back in our funky hotel room resting our tired feet after spending the day in the French Quarter.  After a lovely brunch we wandered around listening to street musicians and exploring and exploring art galleries.

Despite being November it was quite warm and, of course very humid. During the hottest part of the early afternoon we took refuge in the Ursalines Convent, the oldest extant structure in the Mississippi valley, and took a tour. After a stop for refreshments we did a little more exploring and then took the streetcar back to the hotel.
