Thanks again to the beta testers who have helped shape the features in this release.

The Beta 0.4 is now available for installation from the [Palm application web page](http://developer.palm.com/webChannel/index.php?packageid=org.eamonn.nrby).

Changes:


  1. Photos do not now automatically refresh when new photos are available, but instead the user controls the refresh explicitly by pressing a button.


  2. Included with the title of a photo is an indication of how far away and in what direction is the photo.


  3. Miscellaneous bug fixes.


Please add any questions or comments below.
