I am temporarily putting on a marketing hat and creating a product requirement document (PRD).  My first step was to create a template based on a skeleton in a Wikipedia article, together with some valuable details from my colleague Chris.  I attempted to make it a bit more “agile” by using “user stories” instead of “features” for the functional specification.

As I fill in this template, I suspect I will need to make some changes.  But here is what I have so far.
