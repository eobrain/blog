Thanks to [S. "Tetherless" Keshav](http://mindstream.watsmore.net/keshav/main.html), who gave a talk here today in HP Labs, for giving me a pointer to [this promised Two-Terabyte Memory Card](http://www.mobilemag.com/content/100/102/C3080/).  This could change some of the trade-offs in designing distributed systems over unreliable, intermittent networks.
