[ONJava.com: Space-Based Programming [Mar. 19, 2003]](http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/03/19/java_spaces.html)





This is a nice overview of the distributed programming paradigm  in which applications simply read and write from a shared "tuple-space".  Invisibly to the application programmer, a distributed middlerware layer takes care of the replication and consistancy of the data between the processors.  The article demonstrates how much simpler this model is than the RPC paradigm that is used for most distributed programming.
