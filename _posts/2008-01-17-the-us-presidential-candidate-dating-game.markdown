I'm not a U.S. citizen, but I live here and find the presidential race fascinating.  So I took some of the online tests which claim to tell me which candidates are a closest match to my opinions.

What is interesting is that each of the three sites give three totally different orderings of the three viable Democratic candidates.  I am surprised in particular at how poorly Obama does -- perhaps I have been overly swayed by the glamour and symbolism of his candidacy and should instead pay closer attention to his positions.
