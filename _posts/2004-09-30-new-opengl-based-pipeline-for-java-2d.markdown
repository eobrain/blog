[According to the rhw Java Buzz Forum](http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=121&thread=73135) there is a binding to OpenGL in Java 1.5 enabled by adding the VM argument

    -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true

I must try this to see if it improves the performance of our Java app that does a lot of image movement on the screen.
