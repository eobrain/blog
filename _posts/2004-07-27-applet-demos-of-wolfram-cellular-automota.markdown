Rudy Rucker and his class have done a good job of providing
[applet versions of some of the cellular automota](http://sjsu.rudyrucker.com/) from  Stephen Wolfram's amazing book book "A New Kind of Science".

I read the book when it first came out.  It is nice to be reminded again at how amazing it all is.
