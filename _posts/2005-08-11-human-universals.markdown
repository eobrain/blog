I first saw Donald Brown's list of human universals as an appendix to Pinker's "Blank Slate". It is quite a stunning list of things that seem to be common to all humanity, including things you might have thought were unique to your particular culture.  Thanks to [Jack Fenner](http://uwstudentweb.uwyo.edu/F/FENNERJ/) for putting up [this slightly modified version of Brown's list](http://uwstudentweb.uwyo.edu/F/FENNERJ/TraitList.html).
