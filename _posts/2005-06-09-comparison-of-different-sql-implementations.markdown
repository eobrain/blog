[Comparison of different SQL implementations](http://troels.arvin.dk/db/rdbms/) is a useful reference.

I am writing some SQL that I would like to work with Sqlite, Derby, and MS Access.  It turns out there is more variablility than I thought.  Most annoying is that autoincrment is handled differently by each.
