This [anarchist analysis of the 1916 rising and the Irish War of Independence](http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=2937) has some interesting points of view that I had not heard before.   The author claims for example that the reason that the British agreed to come to terms with Sinn Fein is that they were terrified of much more radical left-wing movements in Ireland and Britain.
