Man, it's nerve racking! [electoral-vote.com](http://www.electoral-vote.com/) is showing Kerry ahead by a single electoral vote. [Meta-Analysis of State Polls - election.princeon.edu](http://election.princeton.edu/) with somewhat more sophisticated statistical methods is predicting Kerry 311/Bush 227.  The Iowa electronic market which had shown Bush ahead for the last few months is now closing towards dead even.

As a disenfranchised expatriate living in the U.S. it is frustrating not being able to vote.  Though I did help the literacy student I am tutoring to register to vote, and I am going with her to the polls this afternoon to help guide her through the process.  And as an extra bonus she is mostly going to vote the way I would (I was as objective in my tutoring, honest!)
