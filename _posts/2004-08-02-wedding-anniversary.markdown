Twelve years today. Wow!

We treated ourselves to a night at the Stanford Court Hotel on Nob Hill. Last night had a nice meal at Fournou's Ovens where we particularly enjoyed the wine, Panther Creek, Freedom Hill, 1999. 

This was somewhat of a contrast to John Edward anniversary meal at Wendy's earlier this week. Well he has other compensations.
