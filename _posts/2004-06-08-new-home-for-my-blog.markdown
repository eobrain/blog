Well, the upgrade of my [obrain.com](http://obrain.com) home server from an ancient version of Redhat Linux to the latest stable version of Debian Linux had mixed result.  After struggling with a somewhat confusing installations process I eventually succeeded in getting things up and running, but in the process I lost my old entries for the Movable Type blog I was hosting.  So here I am re-starting the blog again, but this time hosted on bloggerâ€™s own servers.  Hopefully I can trust Google with my data more that I can trust myself.

All the previous entries in the blog were hand-entered by copying from the Google cache or the wayback machine copies of my pages.  It is not complete but hopefully it should include the more popular pages (otherwise the Google and wayback machine spiders would not have saved them).
