So far, there have been two main approaches to the problem of organizing the worldâ€™s information: (1) throw machine-learning techniques at vast quantities of unstructured information, as Google does or (2) create complex networks of interrelated ontologies and apply inference techniques, as the Semantic Web community does.

As a fan of both the tool Mathematica and the book New Kind of Science, I am extremely interested in seeing how the upcoming Wolfram Alpha tool is going to approach the problem.
