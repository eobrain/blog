               [Will Data Collection on User Behaviour Be Forced to End Soon?](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/will_data_collection_on_user_behavior_be_forced_to.php?utm_source=pulsenews&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+readwriteweb+%28ReadWriteWeb%29)      

                                             
 

Interesting point of view on possible push-back from consumers on the massive collection of data about them.  One particular quote:



> no one had yet found a way to articulate the value proposition of aggregate data analysis to end consumers because there wasn't one yet



In other words, while there is a lot of value to companies of the data gathered about consumers, but there is not much value to the consumers themselves.
