Displays photographs that people on the Flickr have taken close to your current location. Flick left and right to browse through the photographs. Automatically updates as you move. (All photographs are copyright of their owners.)

You can install the beta release from the [Palm application web page](http://developer.palm.com/webChannel/index.php?packageid=org.eamonn.nrby).

This is a personal open-source project.  The code is [on GitHub](http://github.com/eobrain/nrby).

_(Update: there is now a [new improved release](http://www.eamonn.org/blog/?p=861).)_
