Using jcoffeescript (Java/Rhino implementation coffeescript) can mean for simpler setting up of a development environment because it does not have dependencies on node.js and npm, which can be difficult to install.  However jcoffeescript is missing some features such as the --watch option or the ability to compile multiple files.
