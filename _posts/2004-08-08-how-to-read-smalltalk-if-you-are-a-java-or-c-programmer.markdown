title: How to read Smalltalk if you are a Java or C++ programmer.

My programming language trajectory has been BASIC -> FORTRAN -> Pascal -> C -> C++ -> Java with a few diversions such as Perl and Python.   On the way I have become a firm convert to object-oriented programming, and as such I always found my lack of knowledge in Smalltalk was a big gap.

Now that I sit near Alan Kay and have been impressed by [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org/)and [Croquet](http://www.opencroquet.org/) I have felt it was time to fill in that gap in my knowledge.

However, I did find initially that the syntactical differences of Smalltalk were a barrier to my understanding, one of the reasons I have created my own [Java-Smalltalk cheatsheet](http://obrain.com/cgi-bin/wiki?JavaVsSmalltalk).

So I was delighted to find Wilf LaLonde's tutorial, [I Can Read C++ and Java But I Canâ€™t Read Smalltalk](http://www.eli.sdsu.edu/courses/spring01/cs635/readingSmalltalk.pdf).
