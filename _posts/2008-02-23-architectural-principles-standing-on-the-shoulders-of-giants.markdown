## Architectural Principles





  
  * Simplicity
    
    * “Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler” (Einstein)

  

  
  * Robustness
    
    * “Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others” (Postel, TCP Spec)

  

  
  * Decentralization
    
    * “Single common point[s] … limit the way the system scales, and produce … single point of complete failure.” (Berners-Lee, Axioms of Web Architecture)
