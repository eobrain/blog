John Siracusa has an written an [excellent article](http://arstechnica.com/paedia/f/finder/finder-1.html) on what, in his opinion, makes a good desktop shell, concentrating mostly on the Macintosh finder.

As an experiment I have set up my Windows XP folder options to to match his recommendations as much as possible.



 
  1. In the folder context menu:
   
     
    * Do view->thumbnails in each folder.

     
    * Turn off the auto-arrange and the align to grid.

   
 

 
  2. In the folder viewâ†’toolbars menu desect all toolbars

 
  3. In the Folder Options panel
   
     
    * General tab: select "Use Windows classic folders"

     
    * General tab: select "Open each folder in its own window"

     
    * View tab: uncheck "Display the full path in the title bar"

     
    * View tab: check "Remember each folder's view setting" 

     
    * View tab: check "Restore previous folder windows at logon"


     
    * View tab: click apply to all folders

   
 



It's like I have a brand new GUI on my operating system!  Let's see how well I like it after using it for a while.
