I believe that Scala is poised to take off as the successor to Java as the main programming language for programming on the Java virtual machine. However, I have found the online resources for learning the language to be a bit weaker than for some other programming languages, so I set up [scalaclass.com](http://scalaclass.com) where I gather together material to get you started and support your continued development in this interesting new language. The site is still in embryonic form, but I welcome your initial comments.
