[8 Definitive Web Font Stacks [Design Tips & Tricks]](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/eight-definitive-font-stacks/)


                

Very useful set of  font stacks that can be copied-and pasted into your CSS. This allows for good-looking typography on your web sites, for users who have good font support, while still making the site work for everyone.

[doctest — Test interactive Python examples — Python v2.6.1 documentation](http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html#module-doctest)


                

Very nice way to do python unit tests, as long as you avoid its siren call to be non-Agile.  It is very different in philosophy from Beck's *Unit style of unit tests framework.  I like that it ensures the docstrings are up-to date with the code.  The main drawback, it seems to me, from an Agile point of view is that it encourages you to copy-paste the result of a test run into the doc string.  That is *bad*.  You should write down your expected results *before* you run the test.  So resist the urge to copy-paste the results of the test run into the doc string.
