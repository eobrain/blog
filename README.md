# Source for Jekyll Blog

This is the code that generates [my blog](http://blog.eamonn.org/).
It was originally based on a
[template by Kris Brown](https://github.com/krisb/jekyll-template).

From a clean RVM ruby you need to do:

    gem install jekyll
    gem install compass
    gem install rdiscount
