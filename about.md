My name is Eamonn O'Brien-Strain.  Originally from Ireland, I now live
in San Francisco.

I work at Hewlett-Packard Labs, where I am Principal Architect
building web services for consumer media and documents.  However the
opinions expressed here are mine alone, not necessarily those of my
employer.
